# bounce_twice_rockets

Default vibe mod generated by `scripts/generate_default_mod.sh`.

Behavior:
- Rocket launcher projectiles bounce twice on world geometry.
- On the next collision after the second bounce, rockets explode.
- Rocket speed is reduced (900 -> 550) so bounce behavior is easier to see while testing.

Run:
```bash
./VibeArena_Build/run_bounce_twice_rockets.sh
```

Mod source workflow:
- Put your content in `mods/bounce_twice_rockets/scripts`, `maps`, `textures`, `sound`.
- Re-run `scripts/generate_default_mod.sh bounce_twice_rockets` when you want to rebuild the default qagame VM patch.
