# bounce_twice_rockets_debug

Debug-visible vibe mod generated by `scripts/generate_default_mod.sh`.

Behavior:
- Rocket launcher projectiles bounce on any impact (including players) for clear testing.
- Rockets use a high bounce budget (6) before exploding.
- Rocket speed is reduced (900 -> 120) so bounce behavior is easy to observe.
- Direct and splash rocket damage are disabled for debugging.
- Each bounce prints both chat/console and center-screen debug messages.
- Each bounce emits an extra visible missile-miss effect.

Run:
```bash
./VibeArena_Build/run_bounce_twice_rockets_debug.sh
```

Mod source workflow:
- Put your content in `mods/bounce_twice_rockets_debug/scripts`, `maps`, `textures`, `sound`.
- Re-run `scripts/generate_default_mod.sh bounce_twice_rockets_debug --variant debug-visible` when you want to rebuild this variant.
